# Introduction

Welcome to my Project No4. This is based on a Electric Vehicles Owners Club. It allows users to create, comment, like, edit and delete a post. It makes use of the full CRUD functionality.

The website contains four Categories: 
- EV News. Users can create posts about the latest news and topics on electric cars.
- Ask The Community. User can find information about latest car meets, dealerships etc.
- For Sale. Users can sell their cars or accessories.
- Technical Area. Users can ask technical questions regarding evs.

# <a name="user-ex">1. User Experience</a>

## Design Approach 

The website is design with a simplistic approach in mind. Some of the features were inspired by the "I think therefore I blog" Code Institue module. 

I have made full use of Bootstrap's and Django's "batteries included" features, where it has helped me to quickly design the website and focus on the backend development.

The idea was to keep the website simple and straight forward for users to use.
<br><br>

## User Expectation

The main goal of the website is to allow users to interract with eachother by signing up, logging in and creating posts. They can also edit a post, comment on it and delete it if need be. All in a very simple manner. This allows them to find information on the latest news for electric cars and maintenance tips.

<br>

- ### A new user:
	- A new use will understand the purpose of the website. 
	- They will want create an account.
	- They will start to create and modify the content.
	- They will want to delete a post created by them.
	- They will leave a comment on any post.

<br>

- ### A returning user:
	- Will edit any existing owned posts.
	- Leave a comment on any posts.
	- Delete any owned existing posts.


<br>

- ### A frequent user:
	- Will check for any new content or features added to the site.

## Color Design

The colour scheame was picked in the intention of keeping things simple and consistent. This has also allowed the website to be more accessible for those visually impaired users.<br>

The Message Alerts have been chosen green to emphasize that a comment or a post has been added successfully. <br>

## Authentication

A user can Sign Up, Login and Logout from the website. This has been achieved using Django's batteries included features and a library called [allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

Sign Up form.
![sign up page](media/readme_img/register_form.png)
<br><br>

Login form.
![login form](media/readme_img/login_form.png)

Once registered or signed up, the user will be redirected to the homepage.

## 404 Not Found

## <a name="wireframe">3. Wireframe</a>
The wireframe was created using Balsamiq. As you can see, as the project evolved, the design has also changed, however the wireframe was crucial in identifying which design approach the website will take.

### Manual Testing
I have been using [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) to check the responsivness of the website.

I have used Lighthouse for performance and accessibility check.

## <a name="bugs">7. Bugs</a>

### Known Fixed Bugs

Throughout the development process a few bugs have been encountered, however a few were paticularly challenging to solve:

Problem:<br>
Initially I could not perfom the initial deployment successfully. This is because I have tried to use Django 4.0 and some additional steps were needed to ensure the deployment was successfull<br>

Solution:<br>
I have downgraded to Django 3.8 for the purpose of this project.

Problem:<br>
When trying editing an existing post, the Image field was displaying a link to cloudinary to whichever picture was previously uploaded. Occassionally this would have thrown a not found error but not all the time.

Solution:<br>
I have chosen to remove the Image field if a post was edited so the image link is not displayed. Another solution would have been to use Javascript to try and disable the link, giving the user the option to change the picture if they wanted to.

Problem:<br>
When adding a new post, the page was getting redirected to the home page. I wanted to redirect it to the post itself however the redirection to the post.id was set wrongly causing an error to appear.

Solution:<br>
The solution was to setup the redirection correctly.<br>
![redirection](media/readme_img/redirection.png)

<br><br>
### Existing Bugs

W3 HTML validator shows some errors which are not present in my code. This only shows when the jinja content is loaded. All of the html tags are opened and closed correctly.
